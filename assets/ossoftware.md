Firetail would not be possible without the following open source software:

- discord-rpc
- electron
- electron-builder
- electron-settings
- fs-extra
- jsmediatags
- markdown-it
- mpris-service
- NodeRT

The software listed is available on the npm registry.

I would also like to thank the following people for their contributions to Firetail:
