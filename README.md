## Current development status

Firetail is currently still in development, however since June 2022 has been developed in a separate private repository. I will keep working on it privately until Release Candidate 1 is ready. I do not know how long it will take to release RC1; I am hoping sometime before the end of 2023 but please understand this is an estimate and may take longer, afterall it's a side project that I am working on in my spare time. It has been progressing well, with playlists, accessibility and quality-of-life tweaks being the focus with more to come. (Be sure to check back for development updates! I may show some screenshot updates on [my profile README](https://github.com/kawuchuu/kawuchuu/blob/master/README.md))
