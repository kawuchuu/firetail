# Running / building
You can either use the executables provided or build it yourself.

**IMPORTANT INFO FOR WINDOWS:**

You *must* have VS 2017 build tools installed prior to running or building on Windows. To install these tools, run `npm i -g --production windows-build-tools --vs2017` from an elevated terminal. You may also need to rebuild some modules specifically for Electron. There are numerous ways of doing this, however I personally use electron-rebuild.

## Run
  1. `git clone https://github.com/projsh/firetail.git`
  2. `cd firetail`
  3. `yarn install`
  4. `yarn start`

## Build
  1. `git clone https://github.com/projsh/firetail.git`
  2. `cd firetail`
  3. `yarn install`
  4. `yarn global add electron-builder`
  5. `yarn release`
